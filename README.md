# ParC-ReSMNet: A ConvNet with global perception for bearing fault diagnosis
Aiming at the limitations of convolutional neural networks in global feature extraction and the low accuracy caused by this deficiency in bearing fault diagnosis based on acoustic signals, this paper proposes a novel ConvNet with global perception capabilities called ParC-ReSMNet.

## Introduction
Here is the paper we will publish "ParC-ReSMNet: A ConvNet with global perception for bearing fault diagnosis".
